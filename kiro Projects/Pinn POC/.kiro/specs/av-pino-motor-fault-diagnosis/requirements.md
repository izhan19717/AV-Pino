## Introduction

This POC implements an Adaptive Variational Physics-Informed Neural Operator (AV-PINO) framework for real-time electric motor fault diagnosis and control. The system integrates physics-informed neural operators with advanced control theory to achieve unified fault detection and control in electric motor systems.
